## üß† **Video Streaming Platform**

A scalable, modular, and fault-tolerant architecture for a video streaming platform.

### Features:

- Handle user uploads (videos, logos)
- Transcode to multiple resolutions
- Stream video efficiently via HLS (adaptive bitrate)
- Support microservice scalability and decoupling
- Optimize for both CPU-bound (e.g., transcoding) and I/O-bound (e.g., uploads, streaming) tasks

## üß± **Key Components and Services**

We'll break the system into independent services:

```
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
|  API Gateway        | <----> |  Auth Service     |
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
         |
         v
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
|  Upload Service     | -----> |  Storage Service  |
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
         |
         v
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
|  Transcoding Queue  | -----> |  Transcoder Worker|
+---------------------+        +-------------------+
                                      |
                                      v
                           +----------------------+
                           |  HLS Packager Service |
                           +----------------------+
                                      |
                                      v
                             +-----------------+
                             |  CDN / Edge     |
                             +-----------------+

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Detailed Breakdown of Each Component**

| Component             | Responsibility                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **API Gateway**       | Entry point, reverse proxy, routing requests to appropriate services           |
| **Auth Service**      | JWT or session-based authentication and user management                        |
| **Upload Service**    | Handles file uploads securely (videos, logos, thumbnails)                      |
| **Storage Service**   | Saves files to a local or cloud location (abstracted behind a clean interface) |
| **Transcoding Queue** | Message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis, or Kafka) that buffers jobs             |
| **Transcoder Worker** | Converts uploaded video into multiple resolutions (using FFmpeg)               |
| **HLS Packager**      | Segments videos and generates `.m3u8` playlists for adaptive streaming         |
| **CDN/Edge**          | Serves static files (video segments/playlists) to end users globally           |

## üß© **Data Flow: From Upload to Streaming**

1. **User uploads video** ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Upload Service ‚Üí Storage Service (writes raw video)
2. **Upload Service** ‚Üí pushes job to Transcoding Queue
3. **Transcoder Worker** ‚Üí pulls from queue ‚Üí processes video using FFmpeg
4. Output segments & playlists ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Exposed via HLS Packager
5. Video is streamed using HLS via CDN edge nodes

## üß† **Why This Architecture?**

- **Microservices**: Each component can scale independently and evolve in isolation.
- **Message Queue**: Decouples upload and transcoding for fault tolerance and buffering.
- **Worker Pool (multithreaded)**: CPU-bound FFmpeg operations don‚Äôt block I/O services.
- **Stateless Services**: Enables easy scaling and deployment behind load balancers.
- **Decoupled Storage Layer**: Easy to switch from local ‚Üí S3 or other object storage.
- **CDN Use**: Critical for low-latency video delivery at scale.
